# Data Science and Law

## What

```Data Science``` and ```Law``` are two expressions that at first glance seem to be apart from each other. Nonetheless, this blog shows that it is certainly not the case. Law is comprised of texts, words and data and these are the artifacts used by Data Science to deliver insights and knowledge.

With that in mind, this blog has been created to foster interesting discussions and, most importantly, real projects encompassing Data Science and Law.

## How

In order to achieve the purpose of this blog, its content has been devided into two categories:

1. ``Technical content`` - The content in this section is produced for data scientists, programmers and all those that have (some) technical knowledge and want to see it applied in the legal domain; and

1. ``Non-technical content`` - Here our reader will find the most relevant information regading the intersection of Technology and Law in the form of articles, papers, news etc.

## Who

This blog is maintained by ``Otávio Attuy``. After several years of legal practice in Brazil, Otávio decided that is was time to practice and study the Law from a quantitative and logic perspective. Technological advances made in the past few years made it possible to bring about this new and exciting approach.
