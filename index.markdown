<h1 align="center"> Data Science and Law </h1>

## What?


```Data Science``` and ```Law``` are two expressions that at first glance seem to be apart from each other. Nonetheless, this blog shows that it is certainly not the case. Law is comprised of texts, words and other sources of data and these are the artifacts used by Data Science to deliver insights and knowledge.

With that in mind, this blog has been created to foster interesting discussions and, more importantly, the development of real projects encompassing Data Science and Law.

## How? 

In order to achieve the purpose of this blog, its content has been devided into two categories:

1. ``Technical content`` - In this section, we will cover all the phases related to data analysis such as: (i) finding and gathering data; (ii) preparing the data for future analysis; (iii) analyzing the data; and (iv) presenting the findings from the analysis. Other than that, we will publish analysis based on real world cases encompassing all these phases.

<ol>

The content in this section is produced for data scientists, programmers and all those that have (some) technical knowledge and want to see it applied in the legal domain.

</ol>

1. ``Non-technical content`` - Here our reader will find the most relevant information regarding the intersection of Technology and Law in the form of articles, papers, news etc.
